## Lending club Q1 2016

**Author: Sung Jin Lee**

In this project I have analyzed and prepared a classification scheme to find the people most likely to default on a loan.

To run the model, just execute the Jupyter notebooks in the repository. Start by preprocessing and then modeling.

The data dictionary and dataset are available in https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action
